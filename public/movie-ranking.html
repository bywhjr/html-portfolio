<h3>The Mommy Return</h3>
<p>
  This movie was great! The evil mummy Imhotep returns to wreak havoc as he
  resumes his relentless search for power and immortality. To make matters
  worse, another ancient evil has been unleashed, even more dangerous than
  Imhotep. Only the heroic Rick O'Connell and his intrepid Egyptologist wife
  stand in the way of these twin terrors as they embark upon a desperate mission
  to save the world.

<h3>Ace Ventura Pets Detective</h3>
<p>
  Funny Movie!!! When the dolphin mascot of Miami's NFL team is abducted, Ace
  Ventura (Jim Carrey), a zany private investigator who specializes in finding
  missing animals, looks into the case. Soon Miami Dolphins players are
  kidnapped too, including star player Dan Marino (Dan Marino), making Ace's
  sleuth work even more pressing. Working with Dolphins representative Melissa
  Robinson (Courteney Cox), Ace closes in on the culprits, but not before many
  ridiculous misadventures.

<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>
  Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny
  beyond his understanding, must travel to the most dangerous planet in the
  universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent
  forces explode into conflict over the planet's exclusive supply of the most
  precious resource in existence, only those who can conquer their own fear will
  survive.
